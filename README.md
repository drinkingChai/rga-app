# R/GA App

## Repos

Instructions to install and run on each repo:

- [Angular version](https://github.com/drinkingChai/rga-angular-app)
- [React version](https://github.com/drinkingChai/rga-react-app)

## Notes
My strength is in React, but I developed hobby projects with Angular 1.x about 2 years ago. I developed the project using React first, then learned Angular 5.x and TypeScript via the Angular docs over ~5 hours and completed the Angular version.

Thank you!
